Welcome to a game filled with action and adventure!
On a quest through the jungle, players must pass and complete challenging tasks in order to get to the next level. Sometimes, players must work together.
The goal is to complete the game and ultimately, win. This requires diligence and determination.
Good Luck!
The game will use for and while loops as well as classes. For each stage, users will have to choose their choice of weapon depending on the
challenege lying ahead. A function will be defined, and lists will be used. Additionally, there will be strings and inputs to prompt the user to answer the question.
Comments will be used to explain further why certain things are used, to help the viewer understand the code.

During the coding process, I referred many times to old exercises.
A source used for while statements : https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/jrangel6/files/home/jrangel6/Day11.py?edit
    This source helped me when I created my very first task.
A source used for elif statements : https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/jrangel6/files/home/jrangel6/Day.12.py?edit
    This source helped me when I wanted the user to input a number within the range of 1-5. The elif statements were used for multiple responses.
A source used for if/elif statements : https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/jrangel6/files/home/jrangel6/day10.py?edit
A source used for dictionaries : https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/jrangel6/files/home/jrangel6/Day29review.py?edit
    This helped me create my characters, without using a class.
A source used for classes : https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/jrangel6/files/home/jrangel6/Day30.py?edit
    This helped me show the health of each character toward the end of the game.
A source used for printing keys and values : https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/jrangel6/files/home/jrangel6/intro-to-dicts/exercise1.py?edit
    This was used to print the items in the inventory list, and the quantity of each item.
A source used to define functions : https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/jrangel6/files/home/jrangel6/day09.py?edit
    This source was used to define a function used for task #4.

I hope you have fun with this game, and remember, WIN!
